# Crop & Fertilizer RS
This proect help us to develop an intelligent system for recommending suitable crops and fertilizers based on soil conditions,climate conditions.
week1 Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation System Using ML
Crop Recommendation System
Overview
This project involves analyzing agricultural data to develop a crop recommendation system. Using various machine learning and data analysis techniques, the system aims to recommend the most suitable crops based on specific environmental and soil parameters. The dataset used is Crop_recommendation.csv.

Features
Data analysis and visualization using Python libraries.
Insights into the dataset, such as crop suitability based on environmental conditions.
Recommendations for optimal crop growth.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
scikit-learn: For machine learning models (if applicable).
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd crop-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The dataset Crop_recommendation.csv includes information on various factors influencing crop growth, such as:

Soil pH
Rainfall
Temperature
Humidity
Nutrient levels
Usage
Load the dataset:
import pandas as pd
crop = pd.read_csv("Dataset/Crop_recommendation.csv")
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset:
crop.head()  # View the first 5 rows
crop.shape   # Get dataset dimensions
Use visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends.
Implement machine learning models (if included) to predict suitable crops based on input parameters.
Example Output
Recommendations for the most suitable crop based on user input.
Visualizations highlighting correlations and trends.
